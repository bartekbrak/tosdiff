# tosdiff
Terms of Service crawler, archive, differ. 

I want to collect and monitor Terms Of Services of services I use. 
- change in ToS is probably more interesting than the original document
- the frequency of changes can say something about the quality of the given ToS or the intentions of the company

Tech:
- let's go minimalistic and not-clever: requests, data cleaning, function per TOS
- store the content as pure text in the repository
- run as cron on some VPS and forget

Services:
- slack
- facebook
- signal
- gmail
- allegro
- olx
- kaggle
